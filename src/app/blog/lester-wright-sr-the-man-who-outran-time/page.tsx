# Lester Wright Sr.: A Century of Speed, Resilience, and Inspiration

**I. The Measure of a Century: Introducing Lester Wright Sr.**
The air at Franklin Field during the 2022 Penn Relays crackled with anticipation... As 100-year-old Lester Wright Sr. stepped onto the track... he crossed the finish line in 26.34 seconds, and the 38,000 spectators rose in a unified standing ovation. This was more than a race; it was a testament to a life lived with vigor and an unyielding spirit. Lester Wright Sr. is widely celebrated as the "world's fastest centenarian."

**II. Forged in Long Branch: Early Life and Enduring Love**
Lester Wright Sr.'s remarkable journey began on April 29, 1922, in Long Branch, New Jersey. During the 1930s, he was a track star at Long Branch High School, where he met Adele, his "high school sweetheart." Their connection blossomed into a marriage that would span an extraordinary 80 years.

**III. Service and Sacrifice: A World War II Veteran**
Lester Wright Sr. served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was among the soldiers who endured the harrowing conditions of the Battle of the Bulge and earned four Bronze Battle Stars for his courage. He served in a segregated unit.

**IV. Building a Dream: Career, Community, and Family**
Upon returning from the war, he utilized the GI Bill for college and opened the first Black-owned dental lab in Monmouth County, New Jersey, crafting prosthetic teeth. He and Adele raised four children. His son, Lester E. Wright Jr., also became a competitive master runner.

**V. The Unrelenting Stride: A Lifetime Devoted to Running**
Wright maintained a remarkable routine, running a mile-and-a-half at least three times a week even as he approached his centenary. At age 76, he broke the 200-meter world record for the M75 age group. At 77, he won the 75-and-over 100-meter dash at the Penn Relays.

**VI. Racing into History: The Centenarian World Record Holder**
On April 30, 2022, one day after his 100th birthday, he ran the 100-meter dash in 26.34 seconds at the Penn Relays. This shattered the existing world record of 26.99 seconds for the M100 age group, previously held by Donald Pellmann.

**VII. The Wright Philosophy: Insights from a Century of Living**
Wright's philosophy: "If you're going to go out to run a race, you should really run the race to try to win." He also emphasized the power of the mind: "It all starts with self-belief... I think it's in the head more than it is physical." He deeply valued his 80-year partnership with his wife, Adele, as key to his "great life."

**VIII. An Enduring Legacy: The Man Who Outran Time**
Lester Wright Sr.'s life is a rich tapestry... a decorated World War II veteran, a pioneering African American entrepreneur, a devoted husband, and a record-breaking centenarian athlete. His story challenges ageist stereotypes and broadens perceptions of human capability.
